## Early Detection of Diabetes
This repository contains a machine learning project aimed at early detection of diabetes. The goal is to predict whether a person has diabetes based on various health-related features such as age, blood pressure, and glucose levels. The project leverages several machine learning models, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Gradient Boosting to make the predictions.


## Project Overview
The Early Detection of Diabetes system uses various machine learning models to predict whether a person has diabetes based on medical data. It serves as an early screening tool for diabetes and can help healthcare professionals make informed decisions.

**Dataset**: The project uses a diabetes dataset with multiple health features.
**Models Implemented**:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Gradient Boosting

## Requirements
To run this project locally, you need the following Python libraries:

pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
numpy: Numerical computing
matplotlib: Visualization
seaborn: Statistical data visualization
scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms
xgboost: Gradient Boosting model
joblib: For saving trained models
The models are tuned with hyperparameter optimization to enhance performance, and accuracy is measured across various metrics.

## Model Performance
After tuning and training, the following models were evaluated for accuracy:

Random Forest: Highest accuracy of 97.12%.
Logistic Regression: Accuracy of 91.82%.
K-Nearest Neighbors: Accuracy of 95.20%.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): Accuracy of 95.68%.
Gradient Boosting: Accuracy of 97.36%.
Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models are the best performers for diabetes prediction in this dataset.



The dataset used in this project contains several features related to health and lifestyle, and a target variable indicating whether the person has diabetes (1) or not (0).
